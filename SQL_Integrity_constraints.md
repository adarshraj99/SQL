## Intrigrity Constraint : 
It is a set of protocol or rules applied in SQL tables or columns to maintain the data security and to block the non-needed data types. 

Types : 
#### Uique constraint: 
It is for not accepting the duplicate values in the data table or column. It can take single null value. 
#### Not Null: 
It enforces a column to not accept the null values. 
#### Primary Key: 
It is combination of Not null and primary key. Here data must be unique and cannot be null too. If some column donot have any constraint(restriction on column to store type/range of data) applied to it and matches this criteria, compiler automatically applies this primary key constraint to it.
#### Foreign Key: 
It is a reference constraint. It says if a column or table is dependent on other column or table ,then other table or column must exist and valid.
#### Default :
When no value is assigned to the column ,the default constraint provides a default value. 
#### Check : 
It defines a requirement must be met by each row in a database table. The constraint can be any logic.
